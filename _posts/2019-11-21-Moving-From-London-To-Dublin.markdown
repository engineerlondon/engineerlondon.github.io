I received a huge amount of support and excellent advice when moving from London to Dublin, some of which has stuck with me and I have listed:
- Moving to Ireland is protected from Brexit in a different way to other countries, "The UK’s withdrawal from the European Union (EU) will not affect the rights of Irish citizens and UK citizens within the Common Travel Area" (1922) [citizensinformation.ie](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving_country/moving_abroad/freedom_of_movement_within_the_eu/common_travel_area_between_ireland_and_the_uk.html) - Essentially as far as anyone knows Brexit will not affect residential status of citizens from the UK/Ireland living abroad in the UK/Ireland, if/when Brexit actually happens then ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.
- Banking:
	* I use Revolut and it has been great.
	* Once you have a residential address you can get a local bank account online using your passport "AIB Basic Bank Account", you must keep >2500 in the account to avoid fees.
- Housing:
	* Unfortunately just like London the Dublin rental market is very expensive and properties get snapped up quickly.
	* Keep in mind that Dublin is fairly walkable so a 30 min walk to work might be ok and will likely save you a fair bit.
	* On the plus side there is no council tax in Ireland.
- Public transport: 
	* Get a Leap Card (Oyster equivalent).
	* Busses will generally cost you €2.25 [dublinbus.ie](https://www.dublinbus.ie/Fares-and-Tickets/Adult/).
	* The *Dublin Bus* app works reasonably well, giving "real time" arrival estimates.
	* There is a tram which serves much of the city.
	* Dublin Bikes (just like London's bike share system), do brush up on your Irish Rules of the Road.
- Health Insurance:
	* Ireland has a public health system and my understanding is that you will be entitled under the Common Travel Area agreements to at least the same healthcare as you would expect at home, ie under the NHS. (I have not investigated this thoroughly)
	* It is extremely common for people to have private health insurance in Ireland.
	* It is important to note that pre-existing conditions are commonly excluded from insurance for up to five years.
	* To make matters worse in this regard, it is highly common for waiting lists for specialist referrals to take over 52 weeks ... yep you might be waiting for a year or more, so find out if your prospective employer will provide health insurance.
- Community:
	* Moving country can be isolating, I found the advice of one friend to **"Do it now!"** extreemly helpful. Their story of moving countries and how engaging with their community versus settling in fully significantly impacted their time there. The point was "Do not put off engaging with your next community of friends".
	* Find your people, they exist! *Meetup* App is a good way to go.
	* Dancing can be found across the city, but I must reccomend [Mind The Step](https://www.mindthestep.ie/the-dance-studios)
	* Perhaps you should join your local Roller Derby Team (Dublin Roller Derby)[https://www.dublinrollerderby.com]
	* Do not delay seeking out and engaging with people.
