- I am a passionate engineer, I teach Agile engineering principals and Scrum/Kanban methodology.
- I believe test driven development enables engineers to produce more performant, supportable code faster and with significantly fewer defects.
- I believe user experience design should be foremost in an engineers mind.
- The last ten years of engineering have given me insight into how good design saves months of development time.
- SOLID engineering principals provide an excellent foundation for high quality OO software development.
